3. "The Project" Section:
Heading: From Clinical Need to Working Device
Content:
The Challenge: [Indus Hospital <https://indushospital.com.pk> is the largest health network in Pakistan providing absolutely free healthcare to 6 million people annually. Pakistan is also among the top 5 climate change vulnerable nations, devastated by frequent monsoon floods. To better support the health needs during disasters and hard-to-reach rural areas, Indus hospital desires to create a low-cost ventilator that is safe and portable. The key requirements are:
Light weight and small size for portability.
Can operate on battery backup for at least 2 hours to deal with unreliable or damaged power infrastructure
Can be used for transporting patients over unpaved or damaged roads
Safety features for lung pressure monitoring and emergency stop
User controls for breath per minute, Tidal Volume and Inhale-Exhale ratio with specific ranges
In the first version, the device needs to work only for adults (no infant or child support).
Keep cost under $1000 (retail cost is over $10,000)
Our Solution: [To solve this problem, we started from the MIT Emergency Ventilator <https://emergency-vent.mit.edu/> open source project. The E-Vent project was conceived at the height of COVID, when worldwide shortage of ventilators was causing severe challenges. We researched several other open source projects that build on the MIT design and found the MPS design <https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/mps-open-source-ventilator> to be a good fit. Our solution learns from both these projects and modifies them in several key ways to meet the requirements for the Auto-AmbuBag.]
4. "Engineering Notebook" Section:
Heading: Our Design Process: A Quick Overview
Intro Paragraph: [Starting from the requirements, we held a series of meetings with our Advisors who suggested various options to explore for hardware and software needs. Given the trail blazed by MIT & MPS prototypes, some decisions were relatively easy to make:
Using an Arduino as the microcontroller for the AutoBVM.
Using a system of gears to exert rotational force, rather than linear force with actuators. This would result in a smaller device (for portability) and better duty cycle (reliability).
Utilize encoder on the motor to granularly control the speed and range of motion of the respiration phases. This was one of key learnings <https://emergency-vent.mit.edu/mechanical/motor-selection/> from the MIT project.
Implement the same user interface recommendation made by the MIT project (user controls for BPM, Tidal Volume, I/E ratio and lung pressure).
By leveraging the existing state-of-the-art, we were able to make rapid progress on many aspects of the design and implementation. There were some requirements unique to the Indus Hospital use case that necessitated innovation and/or deviation from the original design. As a result, we:
Reduced the physical size by making efficient use of the space within the device. With the guidance of advisors, we were able to find smaller sized components to conserve space. A smaller power supply and integrated gears within the motor made the biggest difference. The Auto-AmbuBag device is significantly smaller than both MIT and MPS devices.
Incorporated a power management and battery charging module to enable switching over the battery in case of power outages.
Switched to a 12V ecosystem to enable charging and operating the device from the power outlet of an ambulance during patient transportation.
Conserved power by making a few decisions that differed from reference design:
The lungs of COVID patients are especially resistant to manual inspiration, requiring higher powered motors (15 N-m torque minimum). For the Indus use case, we were able to work with a 9 N-m motor, significantly reducing power needs.
Used non-touch screen display, with aggressive brightness controls to reduce power consumption
Due to low power consumption, heat production is also controlled, removing the need for any active cooling.
Added an SpO2 sensor that comes with the Auto-AmbuBag and can attach to the patientâ€™s finger to monitor Oxygen saturation in the bloodstream. The measured oxygen saturation will be displayed on the device screen, enabling the clinician to modify the ventilator settings as needed.
	The modifications above made it possible to take advantage of existing open-source knowledge where possible, while adjusting the design for the unique needs we had to meet.]
Entry 1: Power System
Challenge: [To design a power system that could run continuously for 4+ hours when plugged in and 2+ hours on battery.]
Options Explored: [
The motor is expected to use the vast majority of the power. We considered using a 24V motor that would be more operationally efficient, but would require a boost converter from 12V input. This would have introduced one more component and a potential failure point. After some experimentation, we found that 12V motors can efficiently manage the required load, resulting in a simpler overall design.
The second most power hungry component was expected to be the display screen. We selected a low power, 2.4 inch LCD display with configurable backlight. With aggressive backlight control, we reduced the consumption to approximately 0.05Ah, which is negligible.
For typical configuration used by Indus (15 bpm, Tidal vol of 750 & I:E of 2), the device was able to operate the BVM while drawing less than 1 A of power hourly. The power consumption is expected to increase under load conditions. This can be tested accurately using a hospital grade breathing simulator, available at the Indus Hospital biomedical device department. For our local testing, we used latex balloons that simulates the resistance and pushback of a human lung.]
Decision & Rationale: [We picked a 4-cell and 6Ah Lithium-Ion battery that is an off-the-shelf component, easily procured and replaceable in Pakistan. Procurement is important as Li-ion batteries have finite cycle life and will need to be replaced as battery performance drops. We can double to total 12Ah capacity by adding one more battery within the same design. The device weight will go up by 529g and the cost will increase by ~$40, but the size will remain the same. We are confident that we will comfortably exceed the 2 hour battery operation time requirement for the Auto-AmbuBag.
For future iterations, we are considering a different battery that is heavier but provides more capacity (8Ah), longer cycle life (4000+) at half the price ($18). This is a potential improvement to experiment with in the future.

Entry 2: The Motor - The Heart of the system
Challenge: [To generate controlled torque to squeeze the AmbuBag while operating in limited power conditions or during transport. This requires a high torque, low revolutions per minute (rpm) motor.]
Options Explored: [
This was the longest part of the journey and led to many frustrating dead-ends.
After learning how to control a motor with Arduino, we first tried a donated brushless DC motor from MPS. The motor itself was of excellent quality and power, but had very high rpm (4000). We had to attach 100:1 planetary gear to the motor, and add a series of additional gear to convert the speed into torque. The mechanical design became complex and the device size became too big as a result.
We next switched to a low rpm stepper motor. We went through multiple drivers to discover problems after problems. The TMC2208 chipset was simple to use but drew a lot of power, generated a lot of heat and was noisier than the motor itself. The TB6600 chipset was better than the TMC2208 but only in terms of noise. Power draw and heat draw was still unacceptable. We then discovered the BTS7960 chipset that met the various requirements and operated the motor correctly.
The stepper motor kept skipping under load, causing it to slowly drift across respiration cycles. This was not unexpected as we had not yet used an encoder for close-loop operation, as recommended by the MIT project. After adding the encoder, we could detect and dynamically change the speed to adjust but the stepper motor was hard to control. We concluded that it was not powerful enough and upgraded to a higher torque stepper motor.
The bigger motor was plenty strong but would still occasionally skip and remained stubbornly difficult to control. We finally reached out to the manufacturer and they explained that stepper motors are fundamentally not well suited to this use case. By this time, we had spent over a month struggling with various drivers and stepper motors, and decided to go back to DC motors.
We first picked a TorqueNADO MAX motor (100 rpm and 5 N-m torque) and had it up and running very quickly. It performed smoothly and worked well. However, at higher bpm and tidal volume, the motor lacked the necessary torque and was not able to keep up with the load.
Encouraged to be back on track, we selected a goBILDA Yellow Jacket DC motor with 9 N-m torque at 84 rpm speed. This motor worked perfectly for all ranges of configuration we needed to support, requiring a minimal gear system in the design. This motor also has built-in support for encoder, which reduces one more component to install in our design. This is the final motor specification we are proceeding with.]
Decision & Rationale: [We picked the goBILDA Yellow Jacket DC brushed motor. This motor met all our needs of low rpm, high torque, encoder support for closed loop operation and low cost ($55). The goBILDA ecosystem also has easily available mounts, connectors and  motor drivers, with plenty of example code we could use. It took a while but we learnt a ton along the way and ended up with a great choice for the most important component in the system. ]

Entry 3: User Interface (UI) & Controls
Challenge: To create a simple, intuitive interface for clinicians to view and set ventilation parameters (BPM, Tidal Volume, I/E Ratio, Pressure, User messages) as specified by our Indus Hospital partners.
Options Explored:
Large touch screen: Provides an intuitive, easy to read and use display for clinicians. Touch screens tend to be power hungry and, given the power needs of the system, we did not pursue this option.
In the end, we settled for a 2.4 inch LCD digital display
Multiple Potentiometers: One for each setting. Simple hardware, but imprecise and lacked numerical feedback.
Touchscreen LCD: Highly flexible, but expensive, power-intensive, and complex to program.
LCD Screen with Rotary Encoder: A balance of cost, power, and functionality. Allows for precise digital control in a menu-driven system.
Decision & Rationale: We selected a 16x2 LCD screen with a single rotary encoder and push-button. This interface was the most robust and cost-effective. It allowed me to program a simple menu where clinicians could precisely set and confirm each parameter, meeting the hospital's exact usability requirements.

5. "The Impact" Section:
Heading: Real-World Application & Pilot with Indus Hospital
Sub-heading: Collaboration with [Indus Hospital & Health Network]
Paragraph: [This project has been a deep collaboration with Indus hospital staff from the start. The design meets all required specifications and has been approved by the biomedical department at Indus. Most of the original requirements are successfully implemented and tested. To ready the device for field testing at Indus Hospital, the following work remains to be completed:
Pressure sensor to continuously  monitor and control the pressure in the patient airways. While this device will be field tested at lower settings, this is an important safety feature we plan to add to the Auto-AmbuBag first. We will be using Honeywell medical grade pressure sensor <https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Honeywell/HSCMRRV001PD2A3> for this task.
